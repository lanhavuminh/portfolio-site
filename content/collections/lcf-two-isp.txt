Inspired by the ballet ‘The Rite of Spring’. Its premiere in 1913 caused a riot outside the theatres due to its controversial nature ranging unconventional ballet costumes to aggressive stomping dance moves to experimental musical techniques for that time. 
This collection shows a new interpretation of The Rite of Spring, highlighting all juxtaposing and unconventional ideas. Analysing the performance as well as the score, it shows chaos with the beautiful, draped shapes that flow in their own way that look accidental but are actually well thought out. The signature of this collection is the use of pleats to create three-dimensional shapes by manipulating the direction and size of the pleats.
