Lan Ha Vu Minh’s graduate collection at London College of Fashion. This project delves into the interplay between light and shadow as a metaphor for the contrast between our outward appearance and the emotions we conceal within. Each layer and texture in the garments reflects the intricate complexity of the human mind—where overlapping elements gradually obscure detail, evoking a sense of internal chaos. Inspired by sculptor Bui Van Tu, who uses a spotlight to cast shadows as the final expression of his work, this collection was developed in a darkened space under a single light source. Rather than designing directly on the mannequin, the silhouettes were shaped by the shadows projected onto the wall—allowing darkness, rather than form, to dictate the drape. Collection made using couture techniques, featuring hand pleated fabric and hand frayed ruffles. Eyelets by Tom Kane.
